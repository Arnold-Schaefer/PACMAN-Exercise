# PACMAN-Exercise
MITxPRO Week 7 Exercise - GitHub Testing and the DOM

<img src="screenshotPacman.png" width='600'/>

## Description
This Pacman exercise allows the user to add a large number of packmen to the screen and they will float around and bounce off the edged. This exercise focused on adding elements to the DOM and being able to recognize the userâ€™s screen size. 

## How to run
Download all of the files to the same directory, making sure to keep the same file structure in place. Load the index.html file in a browser to start the program. Press the 'Start Game' button and then add pacmen one by one by pressing the 'Add PacMan' button.

## Future Improvements
Future improvements could include having the Pacmen be more animated and having them open and close their mouths as they bounce around the screen.

## Licence Info
Code written by Arnold Schaefer using starter code from the MITxPRO full stack development bootcamp course.
